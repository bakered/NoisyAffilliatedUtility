<p>If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> knows that <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is willing to buy at price <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then she knows that <span class="math inline">\(s_j &gt; p\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(Cov(U_i, S_j) &gt; 1\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}(U_i|S_j = s_j)\)</span> is rising in <span class="math inline">\(s_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E(U_i|s_j &gt; p) &gt; E(U_i)}\)</span></p>
